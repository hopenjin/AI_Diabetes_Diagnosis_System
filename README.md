<b>guidance</b> 
  1. We are going to introduce our work to the team members on Nov. 10th at 10:00 AM, so everyone can be on the same page and adjust the code for collaboration and integration.
  2. Each member has a file, and please put your code and work in the corresponding folder. Please upload your work to this GitHub before the meeting so everyone can review and prepare some questions before the meeting.
  3. It is not the final work for submission, so don't worry about the file structure of this repo.


1. download or fork the repo to your local device.
2. install or update the Python package using the requirement.txt
3. move the "server" folder to your GPU machine, and make sure the machine has 30 Gib GPU ram
4. move the "local" folder to your localhost
5. if the GPU machine and the localhost is the same device, it is fine. If not, please let the device with the "local" folder SSH connect to the port (default:5000) in your GPU machine.
